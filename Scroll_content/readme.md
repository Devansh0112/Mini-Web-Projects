# Intersection Observer Example

This is a simple example demonstrating the usage of the Intersection Observer API to control the visibility and animation of content based on sections' viewport intersection.

## Description

The project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`index.css`), and a JavaScript file (`index.js`). It showcases how to use the Intersection Observer API to detect when sections of the page become visible in the viewport and apply animations to the content within those sections.

## Features

- Sections with content are defined in the HTML file.
- Content within sections is initially hidden and becomes visible when its section intersects with the viewport.
- Content opacity transitions smoothly using CSS transitions.
- Content rotation animation is applied when it becomes visible.

## Usage

To use this project, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can customize the content and styling in the HTML and CSS files as needed. Additionally, you can modify the JavaScript code (`index.js`) to add more complex animations or behaviors based on your requirements.

## Requirements

- Web browser with support for Intersection Observer API (most modern browsers support this API).
