# Split Screen Animation

This project demonstrates a split-screen layout with animated resizing of sections using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`index.css`), and a JavaScript file (`index.js`). It showcases a split-screen layout where two sections (`#section1` and `#section2`) occupy half of the screen each. When hovering over a section, it expands while the other section shrinks. Additionally, when the mouse leaves the document body, both sections return to their original widths.

## Usage

To use this project, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The split-screen layout will be displayed, and you can hover over the sections to see the resizing animation. When the mouse leaves the document body, the sections will return to their original widths.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the split-screen layout.
- `index.css`: Defines the styles for the split-screen layout and animation effects.
- `index.js`: Implements the JavaScript functionality to handle section resizing on hover and reset widths on mouse leave.

## Features

- Split-screen layout with two sections occupying half of the screen each.
- Smooth animation effects using CSS transitions.
- JavaScript event listeners to handle section resizing on hover and reset widths on mouse leave.
